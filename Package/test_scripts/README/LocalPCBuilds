lpc_builds

1. Obtain # of nodes and the size of the target sets to consider. Then, randomly obtain at most 30 different target sets to test.

2. For each target set:

2a. Create a directory for that target

2b. Use test_bn for the target:

	i. Create the bnlearn true dag and run local PC algorithm
	ii. Load and use function to simplify the graphs to only contain the neighborhood(s) of the target set for estimated CPDAG and true DAG
	iii. Create plots of both DAGs in comparison as well as the original DAG

2c. Use local_pc_dist for metrics:
	
	i. Add appropriate functions
	ii. Run local PC algorithm
	iii. Simplify the DAGs
	iv. Make comparisons between estimated CPDAG and CPDAG
