Build Results

1. Setup:
* path names (specific to machine being worked on)
* load libraries
* make data grid
* load simplify DAG function

2. Add helper functions:
* Load distance function
* Load data generation function
* Load function that tests the algorithm for different targets
* Obtain file names for the different networks and the network names
* Create the matrix to store the results for all of the networks
* Create the population folder to store results

3. Use an sapply for each network

3a. Setup for network:
* Create matrix to store results for the network
* Generate data and network information
* load DAG and CPDAG matrices

3b. Save network photos
* Create a directory for the network
* Save photos of DAG and CPDAG

3c. For # of targets 1-5:
	i. Create a directory for the # of targets
	ii. Use lpc_builds function
